# Students' Academic Performance Dataset

This dataset contains academic and behavioral information about students and is intended to help analyze factors that affect students' performance in an educational setting.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset includes **480 records** and **17 columns**, covering both demographic and activity-based features of students.

##  Potential Use Cases

- **Educational data mining**
- **Performance prediction models**
- **Student behavior analysis**
- **Parental involvement studies**
- **Visualization and dashboarding practice**

##  Sample Analyses

Here are some examples of insights you could extract:

- Relationship between `raisedhands` and performance (`Class`)
- Comparison of performance across `gender`, `StageID`, or `Topic`
- Effect of parental involvement (`ParentAnsweringSurvey`, `ParentschoolSatisfaction`) on student outcomes
- Absenteeism (`StudentAbsenceDays`) and its impact on grades

##  Tools You Can Use

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Machine Learning Libraries (Scikit-learn)
- Data Visualization Tools (Tableau, Power BI)
